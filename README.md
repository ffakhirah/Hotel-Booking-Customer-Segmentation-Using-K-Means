# Hotel Booking Customer Segmentation 📊🏨

Welcome to the **Hotel Booking Customer Segmentation** project! 🎉 This project uses the **K-Means clustering** algorithm to segment hotel guests based on key features such as **lead time**, **average daily rate (adr)**, **total stay**, and **market segment**. 

## 🔍 What’s Inside:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discover the key patterns and insights within the hotel booking dataset.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling extreme values that could skew the analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like `total_stay` for better customer profiling.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Reducing data complexity while retaining essential information for visualization.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting guests into distinct groups to better understand customer behavior.

## 📈 Why This Matters:
- **Targeted Marketing** 🎯: Tailor marketing efforts to specific guest segments for better engagement.
- **Optimized Pricing** 💸: Adjust prices based on customer preferences and booking patterns.
- **Improved Customer Service** 🤝: Customize services based on guest behavior and needs.

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- **Python** 🐍
- **K-Means** Clustering
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** 🧮
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** 📊
- **Scikit-learn** for model implementation and PCA
