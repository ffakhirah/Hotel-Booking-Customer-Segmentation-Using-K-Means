Without accurate segmentation, hotels are at risk of implementing generalized strategies that fail to meet the expectations of their diverse clientele. This lack of precision can result in inefficient resource allocation, missed revenue opportunities, and diminished guest satisfaction.\n\n\n### **Objectives**\n\nThis project aims to segment hotel guests based on their booking behavior using the KMeans clustering algorithm. By leveraging unsupervised machine learning, the model is expected to reveal customer groups with similar booking patterns and characteristics, such as stay duration, cancellation history, and booking channels. The objective is to extract actionable insights that can be used to design data-driven strategies for service personalization, marketing, and operational planning.\n\n\n### **Benefit**\n\n1. *Targeted Marketing*: Allows for more personalized promotions based on guest clusters.\n2. *Service Optimization*: Enables differentiated services for different customer groups.\n3. *Cancellation Management*: Helps identify clusters with higher cancellation rates for preemptive policies.\n4. *Capacity Planning*: Assists in forecasting operational load based on guest behavior.\n\n\n### **Relevance**\n\nThis analysis is highly relevant in the domains of business analytics and machine learning, particularly in applications related to hospitality management. It demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning to transform raw data into strategic intelligence, promoting more informed decision-making. The insights derived support sustainable growth by aligning business operations with actual customer behaviors and expectations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **HOTEL BOOKING DATASET**\n---\n\nThe Hotel Booking Demand dataset provides a rich source of information regarding hotel reservations. It includes detailed records about guests, their booking preferences, and hotel characteristics. This real-world dataset has been anonymized for privacy, where all identifying information such as names, emails, phone numbers, and credit card details has been artificially generated using Python. This dataset is particularly suitable for clustering analysis using KMeans, as it contains behavioral and demographic features that can help segment customers into meaningful groups. These segments can then be used for targeted marketing, operational optimization, and predictive analytics in the hospitality industry.\n\n\n**🏨 Hotel and Reservation Status**\n- hotel: Indicates the type of hotel — either \"City Hotel\" or \"Resort Hotel\".\n- is_canceled: Binary variable indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0).\n- reservation_status: Final status of the reservation (e.g., Canceled, Check-Out, No-Show).\n- reservation_status_date: Date corresponding to the final status of the reservation.\n  \n\n**📅 Arrival Timing and Stay Duration**\n- lead_time: Number of days between the booking date and the arrival date.\n- arrival_date_year: Year of arrival.\n- arrival_date_month: Month of arrival.\n- arrival_date_week_number: Week number of arrival.\n- arrival_date_day_of_month: Day of the month of arrival.\n- stays_in_weekend_nights: Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed.\n- stays_in_week_nights: Number of weeknights (Monday to Friday) the guest stayed.\n\n\n**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Guest Information**\n- adults: Number of adults.\n- children: Number of children.\n- babies: Number of babies.\n- country: Country of origin of the guest.\n- is_repeated_guest: Indicates whether the guest is a returning guest (1) or not (0).\n- previous_cancellations: Number of previous bookings that were canceled by the customer.\n- previous_bookings_not_canceled: Number of previous bookings that were not canceled.\n- customer_type: Type of customer (e.g., Transient, Group, Contract).\n\n\n**🧾 Booking Details**\n- meal: Type of meal package included in the booking.\n- market_segment: Market segment designation (e.g., Online TA, Direct, Corporate).\n- distribution_channel: Booking distribution channel used.\n- reserved_room_type: Code for the room type originally reserved.\n- assigned_room_type: Code for the room type actually assigned at check-in.\n- booking_changes: Number of changes/amendments made to the booking.\n- deposit_type: Type of deposit paid (e.g., No Deposit, Refundable, Non-Refundable).\n- agent: Travel agent ID.\n- company: Company ID (if applicable).\n- days_in_waiting_list: Number of days the booking was on the waiting list before confirmation.\n- adr: Average Daily Rate — the average rental income per occupied room per day.\n- required_car_parking_spaces: Number of car parking spaces requested by the guest.\n- total_of_special_requests: Number of special requests made by the guest (e.g., high floor, extra bed).\n\n\n**🔐 Synthetic Identity Fields (Not Used in Clustering)**\n- name: Artificially generated guest name.\n- email: Artificially generated email address.\n- phone-number: Artificially generated phone number.\n- credit_card: Artificially generated credit card number.
